Mesa-Like Soft-Rendering Library in C++. It's just for fun. Implemented Vertex Transformation based on matrix calculation; Camera view transformation. Light Effect (ambient / multiple light source); Texture (with different filtering effect such as Nearest Neighbor Interpolation and  Bilinear filtering); final rasterisation based on light and texture calculation result, using linear interpolation. The library can pass Nehe OpenGL sample code from lesson 1 to lesson 6.
